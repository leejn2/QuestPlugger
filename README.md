# QuestPlugger
An app to organize project information with a quest theme.


The idea is to include the most pertinent information that would be relevant for including in a portfolio for potential employers or clients interested in getting a snapshot view of the project process.  The concept would include a general list view of all projects (aka Quests), and a detailed view of each project.  There should also ideally be a Plugger form where visitors can input their own project data to be added into the database, and they can see their project formatted as a quest.
